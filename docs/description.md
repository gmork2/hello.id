Easily validate standardized codes and identifiers

This application is primarily designed to check whether the format of an identifier complies
with international standards and is therefore valid for use in that context.

Not only does this improve confidence in your data, but in case it can't be validated for the
type of data you expected, it also helps you determine what type of identifier it might be.
In the detail views you can get additional information about the applied validation rules
which can be interesting, especially for use in third-party applications like spreadsheets.

If you wish you can make comments and I will be happy to read your suggestions. You can also
contact me through the app (Linkedin link).

Thanks for reading me.
